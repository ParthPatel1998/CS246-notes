### Measures of Design Quality
#### Coupling and Cohesion
coupling: </br>
the degree to which distinct program modules depend on each other
low: 
 - modules communicate via function calls with basic parameter /results
 - modules pass arrays/structs back and forth
 - modules affect each other's control flow
 - modules share global data

high: 
modules have access to each other's implementation(friends) </br>

NOTE: </br>
High coupling changes to one module require greater changes to other modules </br>
Therefore it is harder to reuse individual modules

Cohesion</br>
how closely elements of a module are related to each other
low:
 - arbitrary grouping of unrelated elements(e.g <utility>
 - elements share a common theme, otherwise unrelated, perhaps some common base code(e.g <algorithm>)
 - elements manipulate state over the lifetime of an object(e.g open/read/close files)
 - elements pass data to each other
high:
 - elements cooperate to perform exactly one task

NOTE: </br>
low cohesion poorly organized code are hard to understand and maintain

###### OUR GOAL: low coupling, high cohesion

### Decoupling the interface(MVC)
Your primary program classes should not print things

Bad design: inhabit code reuse </br>
what if you want to reuse chessBoard, but not have it print to stdout? </br>
One solution: </br>
give the class stream objects on which it can do i/o
<pre><code>
class chessBoard {
 istream &in;
 ostream &out;
 public:
  chessBoard(istream &in, ostream &out) : in {in}, out{out} {}
  ...
  out <<"your move.";
};
</code></pre>
Better: </br>
but what if we do not want to use streams at all? </br>
your chess class should not be interacting at all </br>
single responsibility principle:  "A class should have only one reason to change"

Much better: </br>
communicate with chessboard via parameters and results and occasionally via exceptions

Q: So should main do all the communication and then call chessboard methods? </br>
A: No. Hard to reuse code if it is in main </br>
should have a class to manage interaction, that is separate from the game state class

###Pattern: Model-View-Controller(MVC) 
Separate the distinct notions of the data(or stack) </br>
the presentation of the data and the control of the data

Model: the main data you are manipulating(e.g game state) </br>
View: How the model is displayed </br>
Controller: how the model is manipulated

Model:
- can have multiple views(e.g text and graphics)
- does not need to know about their detals
- classic observer pattern,or should communicate with controller

Controller:
- modules control flow betten model and view
- may encapsulate turn-taking, or full game rules
- may communicate with user for input(or this could be the view)
- by decoupling presentation and control MVC promotes reuse

###Exception Safety:
Consider:
<pre><code>
 void f() {
  myClass *p = mew myClass;
  Myclass mc;
  g();
  delete p;
  };
</code></pre>
myClass has no leaks </br>
but what id g raises an exception?
What is guaranteed? </br>
during stack unwinding, all stack allocated data is cleaned up </br>
dtors run, memory is reclaimed </br>
heap allocated data in not deleted

If g throws, *p is leaked but mc is not
<pre><code>
void f() {
myClass *p = new myClass;
myClass *mc;
try {
 g();
}
catch(...) {
 delete p;
 throw;
 }
 delete p;
}
</code></pre>
tedious, error-prone, duplicates code </br>
How else can we guarantee that something(i.e delete p) will happen no matter how we exit f? </br>
Some languages, "finally" clouses guarantee certain final actions, BUT NOT C++ </br>
only thing you can count on in C++, dtor for stack-allocated data wil run

Therefore, use stack allocated date as much as possible

C++ idiom: RAII->Resource Acquisition Is Initializtion </br>
Every resource should be wrapped in a stack allocated object, whose dtor deletes it

<pre><code>
void h() {
 ifstream f {"file"};
</code></pre>
Acquiring the resource ("file" = initializing the object (f)) </br>
the file is guaranteed to be closed when f is poped from the stack (f's dtor runs)
This can be done with dynamic memory

class std::unique-ptr<T> : takes a T* in the ctor, the dtor will delete the ptr </br>
in between, can dereference just like a ptr </br>
need to include < memory >  

<pre><code>
void f() {
 std::unique-ptr < myClass >
 auto p = std::make_unique < myClass > ();
 myClass mc;
 g();
}
 </code></pre>
